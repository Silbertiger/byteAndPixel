## How to build:

- install [nodejs LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- run `npm i` in your terminal
- run `npm run dev`, which starts the bundling of your JavaScript into _dist_, and watches for changes continuously

Note that _hardware acceleration_ must be turned on in your browser, and that _index.html_ must be served by a server for local dev.
